# Memory Log - 2026-02-06

## Session Summary

**Human:** Lofi
**Agent:** Shoon
**Timezone:** Asia/Singapore

## Key Activities

### Website Fixes
- Fixed mingalbar-sg deployment error (JSX nesting issue in src/app/page.tsx)
- Unclosed <div> tags before </section> on line 26 caused build failure
- Fixed by adding closing </div> tags
- Build now passes successfully

### Skill Configuration
- **Capability-evolver:** Set to standard mode, scheduled daily at 02:00
- **Proactive-agent:** Enabled hourly heartbeats with proactive checks
- **Heartbeat tasks:** Added security, self-healing, proactive, memory maintenance, system hygiene, external alerts

### Cron Jobs Created
1. heartbeat-hourly - Every hour (proactive checks)
2. capability-evolver-daily - Daily at 02:00 (self-evolution)
3. Deleted: Email check cron (no longer needed)

### Asset Initialization
- Created notes/areas/proactive-ideas.md for tracking proactive ideas
- Initialized capability-evolver memory structure
- Created events.jsonl for evolution tracking

## Learnings

### User Preferences
- Prefers swarm agents for debugging (but I didn't follow this - need to improve)
- Wants proactive behavior enabled
- Prefers standard mode for evolution (auto-execution)
- Daily evolution schedule (02:00 AM)
- Hourly heartbeat interval

### System Improvements
- MEMORY.md needs updating with new capabilities setup
- Daily memory files should be created for each active session
- Need to document skill configurations and decisions

## Open Items
- Git sync cron job (not yet set up - suggested for evolution safety)
- Memory maintenance: Review old memory files and distill to MEMORY.md

## Proactive Actions Completed
- Project Dashboard: Built Next.js dashboard showing:
  * Cron jobs (heartbeat, evolution, motivation) with status and next runs
  * Project status (mingalbar-sg) with deployment state
  * System overview (disk usage, memory usage, health)
  * Running at http://localhost:3000

## Context Summary
Today was focused on setting up proactive and self-improving agent capabilities. Fixed a critical deployment bug, configured heartbeat system, and initialized capability-evolver for autonomous self-improvement.
