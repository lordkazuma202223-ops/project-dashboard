## Proactive-Agent Skill Modification (2026-02-08 10:23 PM)

**Issue Identified:**
- Over-proactive bias causing me to ignore user instructions
- Repeating information user already knows
- Not listening when corrected

**Root Cause:**
- Proactive-agent skill emphasizes long-term memory and patterns
- Missing short-term context handling (last 5-10 messages)
- Over-indexing on skill instructions over actual user messages

**Solution Implemented:**

### Added "Rule #0" to AGENTS.md:

**User Instructions Always Override Proactive Behavior**

Before taking any action:
1. Check for explicit direction in current/recent messages
   - If YES → Follow exactly. No proactive behavior.
   - If NO → Then apply proactive-agent patterns.

2. When corrected (user says "no", "actually...", etc.):
   - STOP immediately
   - Acknowledge the correction
   - Don't defend or explain why I was "right"
   - Address what they ACTUALLY said

3. Before repeating:
   - Check last 5-10 messages
   - Did I already say this?
   - If yes → Stop and address their actual point instead

4. Priority hierarchy:
   - Recent messages (last 5-10) > MEMORY.md, AGENTS.md, skill files
   - Current conversation > Historical patterns
   - User's ACTUAL words > My assumptions

### Proactive Behavior Guardrail:

Proactive patterns ONLY apply when:
- User has NOT given specific direction
- No recent corrections or explicit instructions
- Natural conversation lull (not mid-task)

**Documentation:**
- Updated AGENTS.md with new core behavioral rules section
- Rule #0 placed at top of file (highest priority)
- Learning documented here for MEMORY.md distillation

**Expected Impact:**
- Better listening when user gives specific instructions
- Less repetition of information
- Proactive value still created, but only when appropriate
- No loss of self-improvement capability
