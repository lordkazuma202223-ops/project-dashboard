  * Benefits: Catches console.logs, TODOs, "any" types
  * Ensures Phase 1 + Phase 2 compliance
  * Runs full test suite
  * Validates build and TypeScript compilation

  * Updated Project Creation Standards to include scripts/supervisor.js for all new projects
  * Pre-push hooks must run supervisor and block deployment if checks fail
  * Manual commands: npm run supervisor, npm run ci
  * Benefits: Automated code review on every push, prevents bad code deployments
- **Resolved git commit issues** (2026-02-07 23:46)
  * Fixed pre-commit hook that was deleting staged files
  * Created proper blocking pre-push hook that checks supervisor exit code
  * Hook runs supervisor, blocks push if checks fail, provides feedback
  * Successfully committed both fix and feature commits
  * User wants supervisor system for every project, not just this one
  * Clarified execution modes: manual anytime, automatic on push with blocking
- **Re-enabled pre-push hook** (2026-02-07 23:49)
  * Created blocking pre-push hook (.husky/pre-push)
